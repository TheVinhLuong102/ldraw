# LDraw

This is a mirror of the LDraw LEGO parts library available at [ldraw.org](https://www.ldraw.org/). It is the same collection of parts, but with all the benefits of version control. See also the original LDraw [Readme.txt](Readme.txt).

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/pybricks/ldraw.git
```

This creates the `ldraw` folder. Use it like you always do.


### Changes compared to the official `complete.zip` parts pack:
- Full Git history since the 2008 re-release.
- Fixed [`mklist`](./mklist) source code. The `exe` files are unchanged.
- Includes [`lsynth`](./lsynth) source code and dependencies.
